            <p>
                Nachos is a delicious traditional mexican meal made using tortilla chips and either chicken, beef or lamb.
                However other meats are also acceptable. Nachos can range in spice from mild to hot as 
                the cook chooses. This cheesy delight is bound to make your mouth salivate from the smell alone.
            </p>

                This particular recipe serves two adults, however more beans, mince and spice mix can be added to
                serve more. A vegetarian option is also available by simply substituting more beans in place of the mince.
